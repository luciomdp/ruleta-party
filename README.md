# Ruleta Party ðŸŽ‰

Ruleta Party is a local multiplayer party game designed to be played on a single device.  
Each round, a roulette decides a random mini-game, mixing bluff, creativity, reflexes, and luck.  
The roulette can even bring an eliminated player back to life, keeping everyone on edge until the very end.  

When only three players remain, the **Final Clash** begins: a timed word duel where only one can claim the party crown.
